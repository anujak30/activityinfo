
<p>Good news! You can use ActivityInfo even when you don't have an internet 
connection.</p>

<p>Enabling offline mode will allow you to continue working with ActivityInfo even if an 
internet connection is not available. When a connection becomes available, ActivityInfo will 
synchronize with the server.</p>

<p>To open ActivityInfo when offline, you can simply type <b>www.activityinfo.org</b> into your browser's
address bar.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> if you enable offline mode, ActivityInfo will store data locally on your computer, which could
be accessible to anyone else using this computer. You should not enable offline mode on public or shared 
computers.</p>
