<p>Good news! You can use ActivityInfo even when you don't have an internet 
connection.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ActivityInfo cannot work offline with the latest version of FireFox.</p>

<p>We recommend downloading the free Google Chrome browser. 
Chrome does not require administrative privileges to install.</p>
