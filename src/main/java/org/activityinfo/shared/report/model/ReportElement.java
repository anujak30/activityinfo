/**
 * ReportElement is the base class for all report elements and the
 * report container itself.
 * <p/>
 * In ActivityInfo, we require that a given report element (such as chart) can
 * be rendered either on the client side or the server side. For example, on the
 * server side, a chart might be rendered to a GIF image that is included in a Word
 * document to be downloaded by the user, while on the client side, we want to render
 * the same chart using the OpenFlashChart flash component.
 * <p/>
 * So in order to maximize code reuse, the report pipeline is divided into serveral types of
 * interchangeable components:
 * <p/>
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Report Models</strong> define the structure and presentation of Tables, Pivot Tables,
 * Charts, etc. They have no dependencies and can be moved between the server and client.</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li><strong>Data Access Objects (DAOs)</strong> retrieve data and do the raw
 * number crunching. <code>SiteTableDAO</code> provides access to
 * lists of sites, while <code>PivotDAO</code> summarizes data
 * into a cube. Currently, there is a server-side implementation based on Hibernate and JDBC, but
 * ultimately we will have client-side implementations that read the data from client-side SqlLite
 * databases.
 * </li>
 * <p/>
 * <li><strong>Generators</strong> intrepret the Report Models and use DAOs to obtain data and structure the
 * content of a report element in <code>Content</code> objects.
 * In principal, generators should be able to run on either the server or client side, but in practice
 * they've been developed for the server side and probably have non-GWT-compatible-dependencies.</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li><strong>Renderers</strong> are server side class that accept Report Models and Report Content and render
 * them into a given format, such as PDF, a Word Document, or a PNG file. Renderers should not contain any
 * decisional logic or access data external to the <code>Content</code> object -- this sort of thing should be
 * centralized in the generators.</li>
 * <p/>
 * </ol>
