Updating the database schema
============================

We use liquibase to version our database schema to simplify schema migration on the test database,
the staging server and ultimately the production server. 

**IMPORTANT**:

Once you have committed a <changeSet> to the shared Github repo, YOU CANNOT EVER CHANGE
this <changeSet> again. If you have forgotten to add a column or need to change the data
type of a column, you will have to add a new <changeSet> element with a new id.

HOW TO UPDATE THE SCHEMA

1. Add a new 'db.changelog-000-feature-name.xml' file for each logical feature. Examples:

   db.changelog-004-targets.xml 
   db.changelog-005-polygon-maps.xml
   
2. Define your changes in this change log, giving each <changeSet> element a unique id 
   based on the filename and your name. See existing changelogs for examples. 
   REMEMBER TO OBSERVE RULE NUMBER ONE ABOVE
   
3. Add your new change log to the db.changelog-master.xml 

4. Run mvn:test to verify that your tests and all previous tests run with the schema changes.
